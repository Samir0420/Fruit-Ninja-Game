 #This is a README for my coded fruit ninja game for python.
 #I have made this game using PixelPad.io

#To know and understand how this game was made, read through the files of code in this order...
1. Main Scripts
2. Room Scripts 
3. Object Scripts

Just remeber that, if you want to see the picture of your fruits to show up in game, you need to add sprites (picutes)
Under "Sprites" on pixel pad.io you can click the plus button and add a picture of your sprite from your computer
